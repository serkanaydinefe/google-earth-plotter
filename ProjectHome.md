<strong>Google Earth Plotter since has been superseded by a web-app, <a href='http://www.surveyviewer.com'>Survey Viewer</a>.</strong>

Google Earth Plotter is a program created as part of a final year project in MEng Civil Enineering at Loughborough University.

The program uses an edited field file from a Total Station as input. It uses a Helmert datum transformation to generate a KML file to show the points, and paths between points, on top of Google Earth.
